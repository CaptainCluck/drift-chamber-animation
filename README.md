This is code for a basic visualization of the response in a drift chamber tracker. For now, using manim for visualizations. 

[manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/quickstart.html#overview) is a visualization library used by 3blue1brown.
To install manim, running `pip install manim` should be sufficient.

To compile the animation, run

```
manim -pql example.py CreateCircle
```
This will render the video, save the output in medial/videos, and display the video in a popup window.
